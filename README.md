## 🚀 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old programmer from New Jersey who loves building things that are clean, fast, and actually *useful*. Whether it's designing websites for hackathons, contributing to open-source tools, or crafting visuals that actually don't suck, I like to explore all sides of tech.

Currently leveling up in **data structures, concurrency, and backend development** — and working on side projects that blend design and functionality.
